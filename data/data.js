        "Hi there,\n\n My name is Mahmut Aktaş and I'm a full stack developer currently working for Ploud for more than 2 years. My tech stack is: Python, Flask, Django, Javascript, React, React Native, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, Docker and many more...\n\nDuring my career, i developed many backend services using Flask. In these backend applications, we've used lots of powerful services such as Firebase, Elasticsearch, Redis, Celery etc. Its thrilling to come across new challenges with each project and trying overcome them as I gain more experince. I also developed many frontend services using React. There are also mobile applications build with React Native that I helped with the development process.\n\nDuring my time in the industry, I've learned many technologies from many projects and I always try to reach better goals with each project. With software development, there is always something new to discover. It is thrilling to explore various areas of software development while building things that are useful. I'm always ready to take that adventure in the depths of software development.",
